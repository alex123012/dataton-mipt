Dear user of the [dataton-mipt]({{ site_url }}),
We are reaching out on behalf of the Clean Beach Alert service, designed to monitor the condition of urban beaches and maintain their cleanliness.

*Date:*  {{date}}
*Stream name:* {{stream_name}}

As part of our work, we analyze beach video streams provided by our service users. Our recent analysis of a
video broadcast with name {{ stream_name }} from [dataton-mipt]({{ site_url }}) revealed that a significant amount
of trash has accumulated on the beach.

We understand that maintaining cleanliness on public beaches is a challenging task, especially during periods of high
visitation. However, based on our observations, we believe that timely intervention can significantly improve
the situation and enhance the satisfaction of both residents and visitors to the city.

Therefore, we strongly urge you to take the necessary measures to clean the beach and prevent further pollution.

Sincerely,
The Dataton MIPT Team
